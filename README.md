# Task-Management
Task Management System which follows MVC architecture with jsps , servlets and css included

# Key Components:

Model (M): The Model is the heart of the system, responsible for managing the data and business logic. It handles tasks, user accounts, and their interactions. This includes data storage and retrieval, task creation, updating, and status changes.

View (V): The View deals with the user interface and presentation. It uses JSP to display task lists, user registration forms, and login screens. It presents tasks in an organized manner and allows users to interact with the application.

Controller (C): The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It processes user requests and updates the Model and View accordingly. It handles user authentication, task creation, and task status updates.

# Features:

User Registration: Users can create accounts by providing necessary information, and this data is stored securely in the system.

User Login: Registered users can log in to access their tasks and account settings.

Task Management: Users can create, view, edit, and delete tasks. Task attributes typically include title, description, due date,status etc.

Task Status: Tasks can be categorized by status (e.g., "complete","incomplete") for efficient tracking.

User Authentication: Ensures that only registered and authenticated users can access and modify task data.

User Interaction: Users can perform actions like creating new tasks, updating task details, marking tasks as complete, and sorting or filtering tasks.

# Technology Stack:

Frontend: JSP for dynamic web pages, HTML, CSS for user interface and interactivity.

Backend: Java for business logic and data handling.

Database: A relational database management system (e.g.MySQL) to store user account information and task data.

Authentication: A secure authentication mechanism to protect user data and control access.
